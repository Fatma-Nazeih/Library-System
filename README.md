This Library Management System is a C++ project designed to manage both printed books and eBooks. Users can add books, borrow and return them, and display book details. The system checks for existing titles to prevent duplicates and maintains a count of total books available. With an intuitive menu interface, it simplifies the management of library resources for both administrators and users. This project aims to enhance efficiency and accessibility in managing library collections.
